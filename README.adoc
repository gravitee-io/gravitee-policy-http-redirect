== Description

The `http-redirect` policy is used to send redirect responses to an HTTP client as described in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6.4[rfc7231].

The URI for redirection is sent back to the HTTP client using a `Location` header and a 3xx HTTP status code.

== Configuration

You can configure multiple rules and their respective redirections relative to the
initial request path (excluding the API context path).

The first rule defined in the rule list that matches the request path will trigger a redirect response with the associated status.

In a rule, `path` and `location` both support https://documentation.gravitee.io/apim/getting-started/gravitee-expression-language[Gravitee Expression Language] expressions. The `path` property
supports regular expression matching, which allows to capture groups that can be reused to build the location
URL using expression language.

Two variables are added to the expression language context when the policy runs:

  - `group` identifies regular expression groups that are captured following their index (starting from 0).
  - `groupName` identifies regular expression groups that are captured using named groups.

{
    "name": "HTTP Redirect",
    "enabled": true,
    "policy": "http-redirect",
    "configuration": {
        "rules": [
            {
                "path": "/headers",
                "location": "https://httpbin.org/headers",
                "status": 302
            },
            {
                "path": "/status/(?<code>.*)",
                "location": "https://httpbin.org/status/{#groupName['code']}",
                "status": 301
            },
            {
                "path": "/(.*)",
                "location": "https://httpbin.org/anything/{#group[0]}",
                "status": 301
            }
        ]
    }
}

Redirections triggered by the rules defined in the example are summarized in the following table:
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
^|Incoming path
^|Location Header
^|Status

^.^| `/headers`
^.^| https://httpbin.org/headers
^.^| 302

^.^| /status/201
^.^| https://httpbin.org/status/201
^.^| 301

^.^| /foo
^.^| https://httpbin.org/anything/foo
^.^| 301

^.^| /bar
^.^| https://httpbin.org/anything/bar
^.^| 301

^.^| /baz
^.^| https://httpbin.org/anything/baz
^.^| 301

^.^| /foo/bar/baz
^.^| https://httpbin.org/anything/foo/bar/baz
^.^| 301
|===

 When no rule matched, the request is routed as usual to the endpoint defined in the API configuration.
